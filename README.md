2. Film Dialogue ： https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/index.html

   (a) “Film Dialogue” is a narrative comparing female to male dialogue in 2000 screenplays of popular films. 

   (b) When scrolling through the explanatory text, animated transitions link each view to the next. 

   (c) The story’s main message that women have far less dialogue than men is clearly communicated by the views and the accompanying text. Yet, the reader can explore each view interactively to investigate individual films. Thus, explanation and exploration complement one another to form an engaging story.

3. https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/aug/26/china-economic-slowdown-world-imports

   This interactive data-driven story contains explanatory elements, such as the headline, text, tooltips, and visual metaphor. It also contains exploratory elements: a reader can explore the effect of different values of China’s economic slowdown by sliding the bottom circle, representing China, up or down. This updates the visualization of the remaining countries accordingly.

4. http://mbtaviz.github.io/

   This graphic juxtaposes a subway map, heatmaps, bars, and text to provide a flexibility in the view. It further supports flexibility of focus by using a variety of small graphics that reveal different aspects of the data.

5. https://terror.periscopic.com/

   The multiple coordinated views shown here allow the reader to explore connections through brushing and linking.

6. http://www.facesoffracking.org/data-visualization/

   Readers can experience this visualization in different sequences by stepping through different points on the right or by scrolling to step through in an author-determined linear order. 

7. https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/

   This data-driven story uses a linear sequence of visualizations to build a narrative. 

   (a) Data is sequentially revealed to create suspense and support the message. First, two uncorrelated data time series are compared. 

   (b) In the last step of the sequence, the author has placed all previously shown data within one view to support the story’s conclusion.
